# University Schema SQL Operations

This repository contains SQL statements to perform operations using the **University Schema**. The tasks involve inserting, deleting, and modifying data for courses, sections, and enrollments.

## Operations

### a. Create a New Course
Add a course `CS-001` titled **"Weekly Seminar"** with 0 credits under the `Comp. Sci.` department.

```sql
INSERT INTO course (course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
VALUES ('CS-001', 'Weekly Seminar', 'Comp. Sci.', 0);
```

---

### b. Create a Section
Add a section of course `CS-001` in **Fall 2017**, with `sec_id = 1`. The location is not yet specified.

```sql
INSERT INTO section (course_id, sec_id, semester, year, building, room_number, time_slot_id)
VALUES ('CS-001', '1', 'Fall', 2017, NULL, NULL, NULL);
```

---

### c. Enroll Students
Enroll all students in the `Comp. Sci.` department into this new section.

```sql
INSERT INTO takes (ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year, grade)
SELECT ID, 'CS-001', '1', 'Fall', 2017, NULL
FROM student
WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.';
```

---

### d. Delete Enrollment for a Specific Student
Remove the student with ID `12345` from the above section.

```sql
DELETE FROM takes
WHERE ID = 12345 AND course_id = 'CS-001' AND sec_id = '1'
      AND semester = 'Fall' AND year = 2017;
```

---

### e. Delete the Course
Remove course `CS-001`. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You must delete all related sections before deleting the course to maintain referential integrity.

```sql
-- Step 1: Delete related sections
DELETE FROM section
WHERE course_id = 'CS-001';

-- Step 2: Delete the course
DELETE FROM course
WHERE course_id = 'CS-001';
```

---

### f. Delete Takes Records for Courses Containing "Advanced"
Remove all `takes` records for courses that contain the word "advanced" (case-insensitive) in the title.

```sql
DELETE FROM takes
WHERE course_id IN (
    SELECT course_id FROM course
    WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%advanced%'
);
```

---

## Schema Assumptions

- Tables used: `course`, `section`, `student`, `takes`
- Common fields:
  - `course_id`, `sec_id`, `semester`, `year`, `ID`, `dept_name`, `title`, `credits`, etc.
